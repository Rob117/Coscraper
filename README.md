# Stock and Image Scraper

## What It Does
Scrapes a cosplay website to look at their products. It can scrape the front page for images (home page archive) to save on the HDD, or a single stock page for stock and image urls to print to console. Please understand:

* This is a proof of concept - it is not robust, and that is intentional.
* This originally targeted a live site, so I changed the names and code around. As such, it will not work without the correct site name entered. Webscrapers are good for study, but always follow the ToS (this site had none).

## Why I Did It
I was thinking about starting a drop shipping company (resellers) and needed an automated way to reship from a different company. This was my stock aggregation tool prototype. I abandoned the idea after finishing the tool because of ethical reasons and costs with the business model.

## What It Was Like
This was an awesome project to work on. It seems like the kind of thing that has a ton of real-world business value. I was surprised by the speed of the program, and it made me wonder what their sysadmin must have been seeing when I ran it!

# Notes
This could have had common logic extracted out into a shared file/environment configs. It also should have some better logic for filesaving (make a folder if one does not exist, etc.), but I think this is fine for a proof-of-concept.
